## Lecture 1
- slide #5: change picture & numbers
- slide #10: look for more recent cool consumer IoT use case
- slide #12: change pictures to show off what we've done previous years

## Lecture 2
- Migrate ESP8266 to ESP32

## Lecture 3
- add potentiometer slide & remove gyro

## Lecture 4
- Add more displays

## Lecture 5 - split to intro (wired stuff + internet - needed for exercises and move as #2) second part (advanced: bluetooth, LoRa)
- cut a bit from the theoretical content
- More details about UART (mode of communication, master/slave, comm flow ...)
- shorten the Bluetooth slides and update for BT5

## Lecture 6
- this is part 2 with focus on Bluetooth and LoRa

## Lecture 7
- move after lecture 4

## Lecture 9
- new onboarding libraries (WiFi manager etc)

## Lecture 10
- Visualization (plotly)
- Elaborate IoT data storage/management
  - hosted (e.g. beebot or [Amazon Dynamo](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/design-patterns-for-high-volume-time-series-data-in-amazon-dynamodb/) )
  - Postgres
  - Prometheus
  - Parquet & (Spark/Dask)
